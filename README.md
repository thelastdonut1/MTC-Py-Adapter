# MTC-Py-Adapter
## Description:
MTConnect Adapter written in python with the purpose of continuously looping and changing data items to be recorded by an MTC Agent
## Goal: 
To make a standalone adapter that can flip inputs and outputs, which can then be paired with a standalone agent for an all encompassing MTConnect demo.
## Progress:
1. Learning how to use core GIT functionalities to make acessing files and sharing project information with other developers easier.
2. Successfully pushed both a new and modified file into the repository
3. Changed the git config file to show my full name and changed the email from "momoore@mazakcorp.com" to "thelastdonut1@gmail.com". Not sure how this affects the users ability to push files to the repository. When using the initial email "momoore@mazakcorp.com", had to enter the command "$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:thelastdonut1/MTC-Py-Adapter.git". Not quite sure what this did but it seems to be working and I will continue to test by pushing commits.
